PRIZM â€” The Multiplexed Self
============================

The ubiquity of the Digital has changed how we understand many things, including authorship, ownership and the Self. What effects are these changes having on how we understand the Individual? How do the standardized presences of social networks, identification systems and customers databases transform individuality?

PRIZM explores how individuality might be designed-out of these systems; creating an experience of the individual online that is completely engulfed within the collective. In PRIZM, the smallest node is a cluster of individuals; an algorithmic representation of its collective 'members'. Central to this algorithmic collectivism is inhibiting the ability to directly represent yourself or perceive the individual other. Without the ability to relate as an individual, the capacity to influence directly is quashed; each person contributes to the whole, but can't explicitly direct or represent the whole group.

In obscuring the Self in the multiplexed collective, does there lie the potential to encourage and enable a kind of individuality beyond possessive Western Individualism?
