PRIZM — The Multiplexed Self
============================

The ubiquity of the Digital has changed how we understand many things, including authorship, ownership and the Self. What effects are these changes having on how we understand the Individual? In these shared digital spaces, where does one person end and the next begin? What modes of individuality are inherent in these networks? How do the standardized presences of social networks, citizen id systems and customers databases transform individuality into a mode of conformity.

PRIZM explores how individuality might be designed-out of these systems. In PRIZM, the smallest entity, or node, is a cluster of Individuals—a MUX—an algorithmic representation of the collective individual 'members' of that cluster.

I see an opportunity for an experience of the individual online that is completely engulfed within the collective; a social network without individuality. Interactions that enable individuals to feel an 'oceanic' connectedness with the collective. What joy might be found in experiencing oneself in the collective? 


Central to this Algorithmic Collectivism is inhibiting the ability to directly represent yourself or perceive the individual Other. Without the ability to relate as an individual, the individual capacity to influence directly is quashed.The result is a collaborative model where the individual can't be perceived, so they can't explicitly lead the group; a mob mentality without the influence of one. Each person contributes to the whole, but can't explicitly direct or represent the whole group.

What is this experience of losing oneself in the collective
 
Finally, in obscuring the Self in the Multiplexed Collective, does there lie the potential to encourage and enable a kind of individuality beyond possessive Western Individualism?
